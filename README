Google AJAX APIs from a server:

Here's a little example code for doing Google AJAX API calls from a server.
Right now it's just a proof of concept using Rhino.

Here's what we've got:
  env.js - John Resig's "good enough browser/DOM environment"
  ajax-environment.js - My additional bits of browser/DOM that were needed
  language-api.js, feeds-api.js, search-api.js - examples
  js.jar - Rhino 1.7R1

To run them you do something like this:
  java -jar js.jar -debug language-api.js

js.jar is part of Rhino, under the GPL and LGPL I think
env.js is copyright John Resig and MIT licensed
the reset are copyright Ian McKellar and MIT licensed
